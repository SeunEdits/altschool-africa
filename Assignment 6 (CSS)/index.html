Trim URL By clicking TrimURL, I agree to the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy
and Use of Cookies. FAQs How does URL shortening work? URL shortening works by
taking a long URL and creating a shorter, condensed version that redirects to
the original URL. When a user clicks on the shortened link, they are redirected
to the intended destination. Is it necessary to create an account to use the URL
shortening service? Are the shortened links permanent? Will they expire? Are
there any limitations on the number of URLs I can shorten? Can I customize the
shortened URLs to reflect my brand or content? Can I track the performance of my
shortened URLs? How secure is the URL shortening service? Are the shortened
links protected against spam or malicious activity? What is a QR code and what
can it do? Is there an API available for integrating the URL shortening service
into my own applications or websites? Revolutionizing Link Optimization Get
